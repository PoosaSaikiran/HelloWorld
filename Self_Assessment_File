How long did you spend on this assignment?
ans : I have spend one day on the assignment 

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Based on my effort i have learned how to create a repository and how to pull the request and merge the files and how to create a file.
i would say i can grade A for myself.

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
I would like to learn more about the github and spend more time learning on this and i would like to grade A.

what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you loof you struggled
Ans: When i have created the repository i get to know the Main branch but when i need to search for readme file instead of that i have created the branch directly.
And when i have read the document thorougly i get to know it is created and there for us and we need to edit that file 
and also i could not able to find how to merge the file. after evaluation i get to know where we can merge the file to the Main branch this is how i have resolved my problem.

Thank you for the Self assessment !! :)
